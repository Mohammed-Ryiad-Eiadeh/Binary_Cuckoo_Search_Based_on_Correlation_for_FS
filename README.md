# Binary_Cuckoo_Search_for_FS
This repositort demonstrates the usage of a wrapper FS approach based on a Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) with an updated Fitness Function (FS) based on correlation functions,. Moreover, KNN is used for the FS phase and 10-fold cross validation is used. Factorization Machiens classifier with Bagging Ensemble Learning is used for evaluation the selected dataset.
